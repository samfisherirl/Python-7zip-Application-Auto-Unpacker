bundles all files into an archived 7zip file with password encryption, uses 7z python lib (or just the 7za.exe file). Call subprocess with 7zip.exe's command line utility to extract and then run.

the encryption just keeps windows' nose out of things.

Compile the launch script here as onefile. Just have the 7zip file next to or in a folder below the exe.
